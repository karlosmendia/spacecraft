A game designed in Python using the pygame library. It's a project developed to explain my students how they can work with pygame to create easily simple videogames with movement and sound. 
It's simply a spacecraft that must survive the attack of missiles that appear randomly with different speeds. The spacecraft can be moved using the up, down, left and right keys. And the spacecraft
can destroy the missiles with red plasma balls that are shot using the s key.
